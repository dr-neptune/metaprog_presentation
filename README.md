# A Spoonful of Metaprogramming

This is a presentation I gave at work about metaprogramming in R. This was meant to be an extension of my earlier functional programming presentation. 

The presentation was given dynamically using org mode, and then the R_metaprogramming.pdf version was sent out afterwards.

The Org file pretty prints the code in github, but does not show the images. The pdf file shows the images (which are taken from M.C. Escher's artworks)
